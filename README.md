# Course Description

The goal of this course is to introduce methods, technologies, and computing platforms for performing data analysis at scale. Topics include the theory and techniques for data acquisition, cleansing, aggregation, management of large heterogeneous data collections, processing, information and knowledge extraction. Students are introduced to map-reduce, streaming, and external memory algorithms and their implementations using Hadoop and its eco-system (HBase, Hive, Pig and Spark). Students will gain practical experience in analyzing large existing databases.

**Prerequisite:** Enrollment in the Data Science program and DATA 601. Other students may be admitted with instructor permission. Programming experience.
**Corequisite:** DATA 601: Introduction to Data Science

# Learning Objectives

Upon completion, students will:

- Have the ability to analyze large datasets using modern tools
- Be able to analyze big data architectures for data science applications
- Be familiar with how to use the public domain big data architectures such as Hadoop and its ecosystem
- Know the fundamental concepts, strategies, and pitfalls of processing data at scale
- Be confident in navigating any modern big data warehouse

# Accessibility and Disability Accommodations, Guidance, and Resources

Accommodations for students with disabilities are provided for all students with a qualified disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA &amp; ADAAA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act who request and are eligible for accommodations. The Office of Student Disability Services (SDS) is the UMBC department designated to coordinate accommodations that creates equal access for students when barriers to participation exist in University courses, programs, or activities.

If you have a documented disability and need to request academic accommodations in your courses, please refer to the SDS website at sds.umbc.edu for registration information and office procedures.

SDS email: [disAbility@umbc.edu](mailto:disAbility@umbc.edu)

# Sexual Assault, Sexual Harassment, and Gender Based Violence and Discrimination

[UMBC Policy](https://oei.umbc.edu/gender-discrimination-sexual-misconduct/) and Federal law (Title IX) prohibit discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in University programs and activities. Any student who is impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual exploitation, gender discrimination, pregnancy discrimination, gender-based harassment or retaliation should contact the [University&#39;s Title IX Coordinator](https://oei.umbc.edu/title-ix-coordinator/) to make a report and/or access support and resources:

Mikhel A. Kushner, Title IX Coordinator (she/they)

410-455-1250 (direct line), [kushner@umbc.edu](mailto:kushner@umbc.edu)

_You can access support and resources even if you do not want to take any further action_. You will not be forced to file a formal complaint or police report. Please be aware that the University may take action on its own if essential to protect the safety of the community.

If you are interested in or thinking about making a report, please use the [Online Reporting/Referral Form](https://umbc-advocate.symplicity.com/titleix_report/index.php/pid364290). Please note that, if you report anonymously, the University&#39;s ability to respond will be limited.

**Notice that Faculty are Responsible Employees with Mandatory Reporting Obligations:**

All faculty members are considered Responsible Employees, per [UMBC&#39;s Policy on Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Harassment, and Gender Discrimination](https://oei.umbc.edu/policy-on-sexual-misconduct-sexual-harassment-and-gender-discrimination/). Faculty are therefore required to report any/ all available information regarding conduct falling under the Policy and violations of the Policy to the Title IX Coordinator, even if a student discloses an experience that occurred before attending UMBC and/or an incident that only involves people not affiliated with UMBC. Reports are required regardless of the amount of detail provided and even in instances where support has already been offered or received.

While faculty members want to encourage you to share information related to your life experiences through discussion and written work, students should understand that faculty are required to report past and present sexual assault, domestic and interpersonal violence, stalking, and gender discrimination that is shared with them to the Title IX Coordinator so that the University can inform students of their [rights, resources, and support](https://oei.umbc.edu/rights-and-resources/). While you are encouraged to do so, you are not obligated to respond to outreach conducted as a result of a report to the Title IX Coordinator.

If you need to speak with someone in confidence, who does not have an obligation to report to the Title IX Coordinator, UMBC has several [Confidential Resources](https://oei.umbc.edu/policy-on-sexual-misconduct-sexual-harassment-and-gender-discrimination/#confidential-resources) available to support you:

Pregnant and parenting students are encouraged to contact the Title IX Coordinator to discuss plans and ensure ongoing access to their academic program with respect to a leave of absence or return following leave related to pregnancy, delivery, adoption, breastfeeding and/or the early months of parenting.

Pregnant students and students in the early months of parenting may be entitled to accommodations under Title IX through the Office of Equity and Inclusion.

In addition, students who are pregnant and have an impairment related to their pregnancy that qualifies as disability under the ADA may be entitled to accommodations through the [Student Disability Service Office](https://sds.umbc.edu/accommodations/registering-with-sds/).

# Religious Observations

UMBC [Policy](https://provost.umbc.edu/files/2020/08/Religious-Holidays-2020-21.pdf) provides that students should not be penalized because of observances of their religious beliefs, and that students shall be given an opportunity, whenever feasible, to make up within a reasonable time any academic assignment that is missed due to individual participation in religious observances. It is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor of any intended absences or requested modifications for religious observances in advance, and as early as possible. For questions or guidance regarding religious observance accommodations please contact the [Office of Equity and Inclusion](http://oei.umbc.edu/) at [oei@umbc.edu](mailto:oei@umbc.edu).

# Hate, Bias, and Harassment
